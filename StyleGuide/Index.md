# Style Guide

The intent of this guide is document the informal coding standards that Octopus uses. A common understanding of style speeds the comprehension of code. This guide does not aim to be overly prescriptive. Ultimately the style is in the hands of the writer and their reviewer.

The styles are not binding and can be broken with if something else makes more sense in that context. Expect the PR reviewer to ask questions.

## Contributing

Everyone at Octopus is encouraged to contribute to this guide as they learn new rules, or break new ground. Post your PRs to #engineering (or to #topic-architecture for a smaller audience) for discussion.

We want to reach broad consensus before merging PRs. 

We may decide not to codify certain topics.

## General
For naming, in a large part we follow the  [guidelines](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/design-guidelines/naming-guidelines) from the .NET Framework. 

For formatting, we follow the VisualStudio defaults other than those overridden in the project's configuration.
